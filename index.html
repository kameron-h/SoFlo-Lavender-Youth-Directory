  <!--- About --->

  <div class="content-container">
    <h2 id="about">About My Topic</h2>
    <p>Florida has experienced a massive influx of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in recent years, especially regarding the
      exposure of LGBTQ+ topics to
      youth. Examples of Florida's anti-LGBTQ+ legislation include the "Don't Say Gay" bill, transgender youth sports
      bans,
      "Drag Queen Storytime" bans, and multiple bills that have severely restricted access to gender-affirming care.</p>
    <p>Young people in the LGBTQ+ community report instances of discrimination and
      violence at significantly higher rates than their straight and cisgender peers. Due to Florida's censorship laws
      that keep LGBTQ+ topics away from children, LGBTQ+ youth are barred from resources and community support that can
      save their lives. That is why this directory was created; so that LGBTQ+ youth (and allies) can find all of South
      FL's LGBTQ+ resources in one place.
    </p>

    <!--- Data --->

    <h3>Data about my topic</h3>

    <h4>Charts:</h4>

      <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2022/#discrimination"><img class="active revealable" src="img/Discrimination_Sexuality.png"
          alt="Discrimination rates reported by LGBQ+ youth" /></a>
      <p>This chart shows rates of discrimination experienced by LGBQ+ youth, categorized by sexuality (Gay, Lesbian,
        Bisexual, Pansexual,
        Queer, Questioning,
        Asexual).
      </p>
      <p>In every category, over 50% of survey takers reported discrimination based on their sexual orientation. The
        highest
        percentages were 73% and 72% of gay and lesbian youth respectively.</p>
      <br>
      <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2022/#discrimination"><img class="active revealable"
          src="img/Discrimination_Gender_Identity.png"
          alt="Discrimination rates reported by transgender and nonbinary youth" /></a>
      <p>This chart shows rates of discrimination experienced by transgender and nonbinary youth, categorized by
        gender identity (Transgender boy/man, Transgender girl/woman, Nonbinary/genderqueer).</p>
      <p>Once again, over 50% of survey takers in each category reported discrimination based on their gender identity.
        The
        highest percentages were 86% of transgender boys/men and 77% of transgender girls/women.</p>
      <br>
      <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2022/#affirming-spaces"><img class="active revealable"
          src="img/Suicide_Community_Support.png"
          alt="Comparison between suicide attempt rate of LGBTQ+ youth versus how accepting their community is of LGBTQ+ people" /></a>
      <p>This chart shows how community acceptance of LGBTQ+ people impacts the suicide attempt rate of LGBTQ+ youth,
        categorized into four levels (Very Unaccepting, Somewhat Unaccepting, Somewhat Accepting, Very Accepting). </p>
      <p>The data shows an obvious correlation between the acceptance level and suicide risk. In communities that are
        very
        unaccepting, such as Florida, the suicide attempt rate of LGBTQ+ youth is highest. This is why it is so crucial
        to
        spread awareness about LGBTQ+ resources to youth in South FL.</p>
 

    <h4>Statistics:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>45% of LGBTQ+ youth seriously considered suicide in 2022 (<a
          href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2022/#mental-health-suicide-risk">Source</a>).</li>
      <li>93% of transgender & nonbinary youth said they were worried about being denied access to gender-affirming care
        due to state or local laws (<a
          href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2022/#anti-transgender-legislation">Source</a>).</li>
      <li>Nearly 1 in 4 LGBQ+ teens have experienced sexual violence compared to 1 in 12 heterosexual
        teens (<a
          href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/fact-sheets/healthy-youth/sadness-and-violence-among-teen-girls-and-LGBQ-youth-factsheet.html">Source</a>).
      </li>
      <li>Transgender people are over 4 times more likely than cisgender people to experience violent victimization
        (<a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/ncvs-trans-press-release/">Source</a>).</li>
